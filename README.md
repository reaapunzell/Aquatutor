## About the Project

### Inspiration
The project was inspired by the pressing need to address inadequate access to safe water and sanitation facilities, particularly for menstrual hygiene management. Recognizing the impact of ineffective water management and the lack of community engagement and education on water and sanitation issues, we aimed to create a solution that empowers individuals, especially women and girls, to manage their hygiene and well-being effectively.

### What We Learned
Through this project, we learned the critical importance of integrating educational content and community engagement into water and sanitation management. We discovered that empowering young women like us requires a holistic approach that combines infrastructure improvements with educational and engagement initiatives.

### How We Built the Project
We developed a comprehensive website and mobile app using React Native for both iOS and Android platforms. The app includes features for sanitation infrastructure management, educational content, and water usage monitoring. Our demo uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We plan to further develop the project by incorporating Node.js and Express to build RESTful APIs, and an SQL database to store data on sanitation stations and user feedback.

### Challenges Faced
One of the primary challenges was deciding which features to prioritize and how we wanted the app to function. It was difficult to narrow down our focus, but through discussion, we were able to refine our ideas. We anticipate that our biggest challenges will come during the development of the app and the implementation of the desired features.

### Alignment with SDGs
This project aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals:
- **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**
- **SDG 4: Quality Education**
- **SDG 5: Gender Equality**
- **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**

By addressing these goals, the project aims to create a lasting positive impact on the health and well-being of communities, with a particular focus on empowering women and girls.
