            <h3>What is Menstruation?</h3>
            <p>Menstruation is a natural biological process that occurs in most women of reproductive age. It involves the shedding of the uterine lining (endometrium) through the vagina, typically occurring every 21 to 35 days and lasting 2 to 7 days.</p>
            
            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>Understanding menstrual health is crucial for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It helps you recognize what's normal and what might be a sign of a health issue.</li>
                <li>It enables you to make informed decisions about your reproductive health.</li>
                <li>It helps break down stigma and promotes open discussions about women's health.</li>
                <li>It empowers you to take control of your overall well-being.</li>

            <h2>The Menstrual Cycle</h2>
            <span class="expand-icon"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <h3>Phases of the Cycle</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):</strong> The uterine lining sheds, resulting in menstrual flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):</strong> The body prepares for possible pregnancy. Follicles in the ovary develop, and one becomes dominant.</li>
                <li><strong>Ovulation (Day 14):</strong> The mature egg is released from the ovary.</li>
                <li><strong>Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):</strong> The body prepares for possible implantation. If pregnancy doesn't occur, hormone levels drop, leading to the next menstrual phase.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Hormonal Changes</h3>
            <p>The menstrual cycle is regulated by several hormones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Estrogen:</strong> Rises during the follicular phase, peaks before ovulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH):</strong> Stimulates follicle growth in the ovaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Luteinizing Hormone (LH):</strong> Triggers ovulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Progesterone:</strong> Rises after ovulation, preparing the uterus for possible pregnancy.</li>
            </ul>
