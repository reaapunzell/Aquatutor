                <h1>GUIDANCE ON MENSTRUAL HEALTH AND HYGIENE</h1>
                <p>Menstruation is a natural fact of life and a monthly occurrence for the 1.8 billion girls, women, transgender men, and non-binary persons of reproductive age.</p>
                <p>"Throughout this guidance, the term ‘girls and women’ is often used as a stand-in for all menstruators regardless of gender identity. This shorthand is used to increase readability. As part of AquaTutor's commitment to equality and human rights mandate, programmes should be inclusive of transgender and non-binary persons who have menstrual health and hygiene needs."</p>

            <div id="menstrual-health" class="section">
                <h2>1. MENSTRUAL HEALTH AND HYGIENE</h2>
                <p>#WHAT IS MENSTRUAL HEALTH AND HYGIENE<br>
                -> The term menstrual hygiene management originated in the WASH sector. After decades of use, there is broad understanding and acknowledgement of this term. Menstrual health builds on this concept and encompasses the broader impacts of the psychological, socio-political, and environmental factors that accompany menstruation on mental, physical, and emotional health.</p>
                <p>#A GLOBAL GOAL<br>
                -> Menstrual Health And Hygiene is important for the fulfilment of girls’ and women’s rights, a key objective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Women and girls’ access to Menstrual Health And Hygiene is a component of gender-responsive WASH services; SDG 6.2 acknowledges the right to menstrual health and hygiene, with the explicit aim to, “By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.” Without considering needs for safe and dignified menstruation, the world cannot achieve the vision for sanitation and hygiene under Goal 6.</p>
                <p>#AQUATUTOR'S COMMITMENT<br>
                -> AquaTutor envisions a world where every girl can learn, play, and safeguard her own health without experiencing stress, shame, or unnecessary barriers to information or supplies during menstruation. AquaTutor’s support to menstrual health and hygiene is aimed at improving outcomes on education, health, and gender equality for girls and women. By comprehensively addressing a range of factors - such as building self-efficacy, developing a positive policy and programme environment, effecting social change, and increasing access to materials and facilities - AquaTutor will continue to support girls and women to have the confidence, knowledge, and skills to manage their menstruation safely, using appropriate materials and facilities, at home and away from the household.</p>

            <div id="programme-design" class="section">
                <h2>2. PROGRAMME DESIGN</h2>
                <p>i. PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES<br>
                -> AquaTutor will follow a set of guiding principles to achieve our vision for access to safe and dignified menstruation for all girls and women. These guiding principles ensure that programmes are building on global good practice and lessons learned from previous experiences.</p>
                <p>#GENDER-EQUALITY:<br>
                - Menstrual Health And Hygiene programmes reinforce equality between girls and boys.<br>
                - Women and girls are given opportunities to lead Menstrual Health And Hygiene programmes through participatory approaches to design, implementation, and monitoring.</p>
                <p>#GOVERNMENT-LED<br>
                - Technical working groups are led by ministries responsible for education or health, and oversee programme design and implementation.<br>
                - Menstrual Health And Hygiene programmes align with national strategies and plans in WASH, education, gender, women, youth, health, and other relevant sectors.</p>
                <p>#INCLUSIVE<br>
                - Programmes make special efforts to reach and co-design with girls with disabilities, girls from minority groups, transgender or non-binary menstruators.<br>
                - Programmes engage men and boys.</p>
                <p>ii. BUILDING THE EVIDENCE BASE<br>
                -> In most countries, the evidence base for Menstrual Health And Hygiene is limited. Usually, there is a need to generate more and higher-quality evidence on the impact of Menstrual Health And Hygiene on girls’ lives, and the effectiveness of Menstrual Health And Hygiene interventions. Even where previous studies exist on Menstrual Health And Hygiene, information may not be available for specific subpopulations, such as remote geographical areas, specific cultural or religious groups, girls with varying types of disabilities, or transgender boys.</p>
                <p>#SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR FRAMING RESEARCH ON MENSTRUAL HYGIENE MANAGEMENT IN SCHOOLS<br>
                1. SOCIETAL FACTORS : Policy, Tradition, Cultural Beliefs<br>
                • Desk review : School/gender WASH policies; curriculum and teacher training standards; reports.<br>
                • Klls : National and community-level government officials<br>
                • FGDs and IDLs : Solicitation of norms, beliefs, and local knowledge from girls, boys, teachers, and mothers.</p>
                <p>2. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS : Water, Sanitation And Resource Availability<br>
                • Observations in schools and communities : WASH conditions; availability and cost of MHM supplies.<br>
                • KIIs with teachers : Availability of resources and support for WASH; teachers’ role in educating girls.<br>
                • FGDs with girls : Perceptions of school environment; use of Wash facilities.</p>
                <p>3. INTERPERSONAL FACTORS : Relationships With Family, Teachers, Peers<br>
                • FGDs with girls, boys and mothers : Perceptions of changes in gender roles post-menarche; relationships with family, peers, and teachers; access to support for information, practical guidance, and supplies.<br>
                • KIIs with teachers : Role of teachers in supporting girls; changes in girls’ interactions with others.</p>
                <p>4. PERSONAL FACTORS : Knowledge, Skills, Beliefs<br>
                • FGDs and IDIs with girls : Biological knowledge about menstruation and practical knowledge about menstrual hygiene management; coping mechanisms and behavioural adaptations; needs; attitudes and beliefs about menstruation; self-efficacy regarding management.</p>
                <p>5. BIOLOGICAL FACTORS: Age, Intensity Of Menstruation, Cycle<br>
                • IDIs with girls : Severity of pain, including headaches and cramps, and influence on behaviour and school experience; intensity of flow and ability to manage menstruation in school setting; weakness, ability to concentrate, fatigue.</p>

            <div id="core-package" class="section">
                <h2>3. CORE PACKAGE OF INTERVENTION</h2>
                <p>#BUILDING SKILLS AND CAPACITY<br>
                Menstrual health and hygiene interventions build the skills and capacity of girls and women and their communities, including teachers and service providers. WASH services and supplies provide an entry point, but skills-based approaches, including participatory learning and peer-to-peer education, also play an important role. Evidence-based knowledge of puberty and menstruation is needed to build the skills and confidence of girls and women to manage their menstruation in a healthy way. Boys and men also require knowledge and skills to support their female counterparts, challenge gender inequalities, and contribute to positive social change. This core area ensures that both service providers and clients have the skills and capacity needed to manage menstruation.</p>
                <p>1. GUIDANCE FOR TEACHERS:<br>
                -> AquaTutor and partners, working closely with UNICEF, has developed a comprehensive set of guidance materials for teachers. These materials will be used as part of a workshop to help teachers understand menstrual health and hygiene, and how to support students’ needs in a sensitive and age-appropriate manner.<br>
                -> Menstrual health and hygiene sessions will be integrated into the formal school curriculum and teacher training programmes.<br>
                -> AquaTutor and partners will also train school counsellors on menstrual health and hygiene, including common myths and misconceptions.</p>
                <p>2. MHM FACILITY DESIGN:<br>
                -> The design of school WASH facilities is crucial to ensure that girls can manage their menstruation hygienically and with dignity. Facilities must meet the specific needs of menstruating girls, including privacy, cleanliness, and access to water and soap.<br>
                -> AquaTutor will support schools in designing, upgrading, or maintaining WASH facilities that are gender-sensitive, child-friendly, and inclusive.<br>
                -> Gender-segregated latrines and handwashing facilities with soap will be provided in all schools.<br>
                -> Schools will also have waste management systems in place, including the safe disposal of used menstrual materials.</p>
