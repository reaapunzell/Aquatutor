<section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction & Scope</h2>
    <p>Sanitation and water are fundamental components of human health, economic development, and environmental sustainability. Access to safe and adequate sanitation and water services is essential for preventing the spread of diseases, promoting human dignity, and supporting economic growth. However, millions of people worldwide lack access to basic sanitation and water services, leading to significant health, economic, and environmental impacts.</p>
    <p>The scope of sanitation and water encompasses various aspects, including water supply, sanitation, hygiene, wastewater management, water resource management, water quality monitoring, sanitation infrastructure, water and sanitation services, water and sanitation policy, and water and sanitation innovation. These components are interconnected and critical to ensuring the well-being of present and future generations.</p>
    <p>Water supply refers to the safe and reliable access to drinking water, including source protection, treatment, storage, and distribution. Sanitation involves the management of human waste, including toilets, wastewater treatment, and fecal sludge management. Hygiene practices and behaviors prevent the spread of diseases, such as handwashing with soap. Wastewater management includes the collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater from households, industries, and agricultural activities.</p>

    <h2>What is Menstruation?</h2>
        <p>Menstruation, often referred to as a period, is a natural process that occurs in the female body.

        <li><strong>Maintain Personal Hygiene:</strong> Wash your hands before and after changing menstrual products. Clean your genital area daily with warm water and mild soap. Avoid harsh soaps or douches as they can disrupt the natural balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Dispose of Products Properly:</strong> Wrap used pads or tampons in toilet paper or their wrapper and dispose of them in a bin. Do not flush them down the toilet as they can cause blockages.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Prepared:</strong> Keep extra menstrual products in your bag. Having a small emergency kit can be helpful.</li>
